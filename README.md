# LearningJavaScript

Hello everybody,
this repository will serve as my PATH towards learning JavaScript. Inside this repository I will have different folders with code examples
for all kind of notions about Javascript. Feel free to contribute.

<h2> Current folder structure </h2>

<ul>
  <li>Welcome.js -- just a welcome script file</li>
  <li>Functions - folder with scripts that have to do with functions, such as function declaration, function expressions, closures</li>
</ul
